                              the
                              1981 children's book by Chris Van Allsburg and the first installment of the Jumanji
                              franchise.
                              The
                              film was written by Van Allsburg, Greg Taylor, Jonathan Hensleigh, and Jim Strain and

                              The story centers on a supernatural board game that releases jungle-based hazards upon its

                              with every turn they take. As a boy in 1969, Alan Parrish became trapped inside the game

                              the quartet resolves to finish the game in order to reverse all of the destruction it has
                              caused.</p>
